Polymath FIRE is a term I made up to describe my FIRE journey and goals. I bet some of you have similar plans, but just don’t call it this. A polymath is anyone who has deep knowledge and interest in several different areas. For me these interests are a mix of academic (philosophy, thermodynamics [as it relates to biological systems], genetic engineering) and non-academic (art and hobby herpetology). My FIRE plan is designed to allow me to maximize my polymath style interests in these fields without worrying about whether they will make money for me or not.
 
Historically, people who have had the luxury of philosophizing, making art, and doing basic science did so because they came from wealthy families or were otherwise financially independent. My plan is to become financially independent so I can do the same.
 
**Numbers at a glance:**
I’m a 31F with a 33M husband. No kids, but we want kids soon. Current NW is around $550,000 (Home, business assets, index funds, stock from startups). We live in a borderline MCOL/HCOL area.
 
**FIRE Journey Background:**
Neither my husband or I come from wealthy backgrounds.
 
We got married when I was 25 and he was 27. After I graduated with my MS In bioengineering (I was 27 and my husband was 29) we had a net worth of about -$55,0000 with our combined debt (student and credit card). I really wanted to go for PhD at this time after completing my MS, but my husband wasn’t earning much money at the time and we were really feeling the pinch of having a low income and so much debt.
 
Around when I graduated, a family member showed us Dave Ramsey and we immediately took to it. The same family members then showed us FIRE and we took to that that quickly as well. Here’s some numbers by dates:
 
2017: Fresh out college. Not working a real job yet (biotech internship, rock climbing instructor). Husband working in film industry.
·       Combined annual income: ~$55,000
·       Total Net Worth: -$57,000
 
2018: I started working part time as a biomedical engineer and split my time trying to start a business (which did not pan out) Husband salary stays about the same. We started aggressively throwing money at getting out of debt this year.
·      Combined annual income: ~$80,000
·      Total Net Worth: -$25,000
 
2019: I got a better job as Product Manager for a global medical device company and got a substantial raise (let the business venture fail and moved on). Husband’s income went down slightly because we had to move and his work was mostly network based and freelance. We got out of debt this year! I got a $10K inheritance this year from my grandmother this year as well.
·      Combined annual income: $160K
·      Total Net Worth: $70K
 
2020: Our income stays about this same, but net worth grows.
·      Combined annual income: $170K
·      Total Net Worth: $170K
 
2021: My husband cracks the code on how to make good money in the film industry and I get a 15% raise at my job. The house we bought in 2020 went up dramatically in value this year.
·      Combined annual income: $300K
·      Total Net Worth: $500K
 
 
2022: I started a new job as an alliance manager in biotech in January with total comp just over $200K and my husband is tracking to make north of $200k this year as well.
·      Combined annual income: estimated $400K
·      Total Net Worth: estimated ~$650K-$700K  (by end of 2022)
 
 
 
**The typical FIRE struggle of delayed gratification**
Money was historically a huge stress for us and it’s just now starting to feel better. We’ve started spending a bit more money, but still have a savings rate of around 65-75%.  We both decided becoming financially stable was a priority, but it has come at a huge cost- mostly for me. I don’t enjoy the day-to-day of the corporate grind but try my best to stay positive and grateful.
 
My husband got to stay in the film industry which he loves. He didn’t make much in film for a long time and the last 3 years of him figuring out how to thrive in that industry was largely subsidized by me working a job I don’t enjoy.
 
I don’t feel intellectually fulfilled by the work that I do and I don’t feel like I can bring much of my authentic self to my corporate job. I also don’t enjoy the corporate grind, the lack of balance in having time for things I actually enjoy. I’ve also come to terms with the fact that I’m just an easily stressed out and anxiety prone person. It was never too bad in my early 20’s, but the corporate grind has really brought this out in me. Since the pandemic, I’ve started struggling more with my mental health, burn out, and am not very motivated to try too hard at work.  
 
I try to stay positive and there is a lot I’m getting from the experience, but it’s just so far from what I want to be doing with my time and my life. I often dream about quitting, going back for a PhD in philosophy, going on exotic tropical herping trips, and making bio-inspired art. Writing books, and maybe taking a role as a university professor. My dream life!
 
But every time I look at the numbers, it’s so hard. I make over $200K a year now and a PhD stipend would be less than $30K/ year. With kids hopefully coming in the near future, I just can’t justify it.
 
I do some things in my free time to scratch this itch. In 2021 I published my first book about entropy, biology, and philosophy. It was very fun for me, and confirmed that this is something I’d be much happier doing.
 
 
**The Final Stretch to Polymath FIRE**
The ideal situation would be for us to be fully FI before I step away from my high earning job. The reality is that I’ll probably leave before we’re fully FI, because I’m nearing the end of my rope working corporate jobs that make me unhappy.
 
At our current spend rate (which will change with kids), We’d hit our FI number of ~$1.9M in about 6-7 years. Realistically we’re looking at 7-10 years depending on our situation with kids and how that affects our spending and savings rate. A lot also depends on how my startup stock performs.  
 
About 20% of my total comp at my current job is stock that doesn’t fully vest for 4 years. I’m going to try to make it at least 3 more years at this job (and do what I can to find more joy and balance in life), but ideally will make it all 4 years. My husband and I have plans to grow his business more which we think could replace my income in the next 3-4 years and we also have plans to get into rental properties.
 
All told- I should be good to leave my current job in the next 3 years or so, even though we won’t be fully FI yet.
 
This puts us in a FIRE gray area. We’ll definitely have a good amount of FU money when I step away from my corporate work, but we won’t be truly FI yet.
 
With the Polymath FIRE plan, there is no guarantee I’ll make any money beyond what I make for my PhD stipend (worst case). But I do have plans that could ultimately make even more than what I make now (discussed in the next section). There’s just no guarantee it would happen.  
 
This means that there’s a very real possibility my husband will have to extend his FIRE date for me to step away from my high earning job sooner. At this rate, our worst case is that my husband needs to work until he is 47 for us to be truly financially independent. He plans to keep working well beyond 47 since he really loves what he does, and this doesn’t bother him. After we’re FI, he’d like to be more choosy about what projects he works on and hire someone to take over more of the business operations – but he plans to keep working. For us, FIRE really is about teamwork.
 
 
**Polymath FIRE in Action**
Here’s a breakdown of my ideal Polymath FIRE situation. ~*Dreams*~
 
Work 3-4 more years at the corporate biotech firm making $200K+ a year. After this, I’d love to take a 1 year sabbatical to detox the last 10 years of corporate sadness out of me. This year, I’d like to spend more time with family and friends, go herping, make art, read, relax, and spend time outside. I’d also spend some time this year gearing up to go back for a PhD.
 
After taking the year off, I’d ideally start my PhD in philosophy at a nearby state university. There’s no guarantee I’d get in, but do feel pretty well set up for this given that I got expectational grades before, have good recommendations, and have a unique spin on what I want to do with a Philosophy PhD.
 
After my PhD, it’s all about how I’m feeling and what sounds fun. I might take another 6 months off to travel with my husband and hang out. Who knows? I’ll have options.
 
There are some things that sound really fun to me now, but I don’t know how fun they will sound in 10 years when we have kids. If I still feel like it in 10 years, here are some projects that excite me:
 
·      Writing books about philosophy and technology
·      Doing speaking engagements at tech conferences and at tech companies about philosophy and technology
·      Making bio-inspired art
·      Going on exotic tropical herpetology trips
·      Becoming a part-time professor in philosophy
·      Publishing papers and collaborating with other academics in fields of biology/thermodynamics
·      Starting a moon-shot style synthetic biology company (or providing early funding/ advising one)
·      Writing a sci-fi book/ series
 
**TLDR;**
There’s so much I want to do in life, so much I’m excited about, and so many things that bring me joy. Unfortunately, my current job doesn’t fit into these categories. It makes me sad, anxious, and doesn’t allow me to be my authentic self. I’m sticking it out for the paycheck for now, so I can afford to be my weirdo polymath self later in life and not worry about making money. I struggle daily with the tradeoff of delayed gratification and do my best to find balance, but keep coming back to this plan every time I reassess.
 
Wish me luck on getting to my financially independent dream life and hope you get to yours as well!",FIREyFemmes

My employer acknowledges excellence, but never rewards it.  After five years of stellar reviews, taking on a lot of additional work, and winning two prestigious company awards, I recently asked my boss about the possibility of a raise; she laughed, and told me the company doesn't ever give raises.

This was a job I loved, and would have probably stuck with for many more years, but I simply can't afford to stay with a company that will cripple my ability to ever retire.

Since the conversation with my boss, I've vacillated between really angry and sad, and I mostly feel burnt out and checked-out.  I literally can't muster anywhere near the enthusiasm I once had, and I just don't care.  I'm training for another career field, but it will probably be another year before I can transition.  I'm hoping I can land a job with an employer that rewards high performing employees with raises and benefits and not bullshit pats on the head.",FIREyFemmes
0,EBeewtf,/r/FIREyFemmes/comments/syhuls/is_it_wrong_that_i_want_to_be_wealthy/,"First, I’m not sure is wealthy is even the correct word. I want to be extremely comfortable, however. 

I’ve always been made to feel like this is wrong in some way, or obvious and unrealistic in others. Like, duh you want to be rich. You live in America where money is worshipped and makes life both easy and fun. 

I feel like when I’ve said this to my cousin, expressed wanting a high income, he’s kind of scoffed at me. But he is rich now. He makes like $200k a year working in cyber securities. Why was it funny for me to want to be wealthy, but it’s not funny for him to be wealthy? And if you’ve seen me on these boards, you know I’m sort of fcked in that realm. Got sick. Lost career. Lost most things. Almost became homeless. That’s how I found FIRE in the first place. While I was pretty much homeless and living on my grandparent’s living room floor while incredibly ill and realizing how important money is and how I was never taught how to build wealth for my own safety. That’s really how I view wealth. It’s safety. It’s choices and options. 

Anyways. I’m still having a hard time figuring out my place in this new—to me—world. I’ve been applying to jobs and it almost looks like I am going to be at the lowest rung. That my bachelors degree in literature actually is the joke people said it would be, and I am pretty much only going to be fit for jobs that a degree-less person could get. My only answer back has been TD bank for a teller job. Originally I worked in film and wanted to be a writer and write film. Like a fcking moron. 

Anyway, even when I was seeing this therapist briefly, talking about what I wanted to do/money I wanted to make was made into some —*huh*—type of thing. This is actually why I stopped going to her, lol. But when I was expressing my want to be in a leadership position, make over six figures, she made some comment about me wanting to have power over others. Like, as if I was saying I wanted to control people/show off. It made me feel like she was calling me an egomaniac or something. I was going to her so I could get out of my post-chronic illness trauma funk and get back into the world and work. But she just made me feel bad about myself and we didn’t jive. It happens!

But, is it bad or unrealistic that I wish to have a job in a certain income bracket? Nothing crazy, but it is my goal to eventually make in the high six figures. Whatever I wind up doing. Is there something weird about that being a focus for me??",FIREyFemmes

0,hazeazure,/r/FIREyFemmes/comments/syr3gz/burnt_out_in_job_hubby_just_fired/,"Am struggling with work exhaustion due to multiple factors:

1. Change of job scope (environment, people and systemic changes) 

2. Taking on a leadership role (from a mentor that was seriously loved) - I'm not a natural leader, but I do love some aspects of my job. The adminstration part is definitely not the part I love, and I'm really swamped with it this year. Am not a very decisive nor confident person either, and I think this doesn't help me. Trying to find out my gaps and working on them, point by point. 

3. Hubby just FIRED last year end - think this seems to make me even more 🔥 to also reach Fire. Context- he has always wanted to fire since he was 18, so when he could last year, I was super happy for him. Unfortunately, it's been a tough transition as I can't help but see how carefree he is at home. He has been supportive and a good listening ear, giving good advice when I most need it.

Am wondering, is there anyone who has gone through this and have good advice, esp those who have fired? I feel burned out, and keep wishing I can travel. Have also broken down in tears about 5 times just this start of the year. Am thinking of seeing a counselor, but I think my situation is rather unique. My thanks in advance 😊",FIREyFemmes
0,devindares,/r/FIREyFemmes/comments/syw2eo/what_to_do_with_new_paycheck/,"Just got a new job with a 115k base salary and my OTE for year one is 300k. I'm not sure what to do first and then next. 

Step 1 Create a budget: done

Step 2: Build small emergency fund: done

Step 3: Contribute enough to get employer retirement match. My employer does not offer a retirement match. 

Step 4: Any high interest debt? $1,561 high interest credit card debt. This is in my partners name where I'm an authorized user. She's okay with using gig app work to pay this off. I can also knock this out with my second paycheck. 

Step 5: Increase emergency fund to 3-6 months. This will already be done after my first check in four days. 

Step 6: Any moderate interest debt? I have some student loans that hover around 4%. The highest one is below 6%. 

Step 7: Evaluate the merits of a Roth vs Traditional IRA. Since I'll be making so much I'm not sure which one will be a better fit. I'd rather pay taxes now and have an account I can borrow from to buy an investment property with. Which is the best way to go? 

Step 8: Any large required purchases or personal investments in the future? Yes, I'm in university and that costs about $4k per term (1 term= 6 months). I have about five terms left ($20k) if I don't accelerate through the program as I'd like to. Should I put this money into a 529 account instead of a 401k? I can always take out student loans or gig app work to pay for school. However, my goal is to buy a multi-family real estate investment property this year in my name alone. The personal finance flow chart says put that money into a checking account, but a 529 seems to perhaps make more sense in saving for school. Where should school money go? Should I just gig app work for this money? It would mean driving ten nights per month doing gig app work. IMO not a big deal. 

Step 9: Am I saving 15% for retirement? Not yet. I only have about $4,333 in my retirement account as I've just started saving for it. I would however like to FIRE asap. My thoughts are doing this through buying multifamily real estate properties so eventually I don't need to work a day job and can just focus on real estate investing. 

Step 10: If self employed contribute to a SEP-IRA or SIMPLE IRA. What's the difference here? My rental real estate income counts in that category so does gig app work. I've also heard about self directed IRAs and I'm not sure how to start one of those or the advantages of one. 

Step 10: Contribute to a HSA if eligible. I have a low deductible health plan. 

Step 11: Save for kids college. I don't have kiddos and don't plan on this. My one dog is enough at this moment. 

Step 12: Would you like to retire early? Of course, that's why I'm here. Consider a mega backdoor IRA. What is that and how would I take advantage of one? Why not invest in real estate instead of index funds? 

Long term goals: 

\-Aquire ten multi-family real estate properties in the next 19 years. I think I might be able to do this much quicker. Where's a good place to get a mentor for this? I am a member of the Bigger Pockets community. 

\-FatFire! Is it best to do this through index fund investing, real estate, or a mix of both? My science teacher once said that real estate will be a much safer long term investment with global warming (supply chain issues) and war in the picture. 

\-Launch a SaaS product aimed at real estate investors. Not sure on how to get started on this one. I just started to code the project last night. Where's a good place to get a mentor for this? 

TLDR: Multiple questions on where to put my money and how to reach my long term goals the fastest.

0,labbitlove,/r/FIREyFemmes/comments/sz31u6/purchasing_a_home_solo_has_anyone_done_this_and/,"A little bit of context. I'm 34F and make a decent living as a people manager in tech. My work just went completely remote as of last week and I'm starting to think of alternatives to living in my currently VHCOL city. I've always been a bit more nomadic and questioned whether or not owning a home was something I actually wanted, or something that was sold to us by former generations as the American Dream.

Reasons why I want to buy a house:

\- It's really difficult for me to estimate my future expenditures when housing costs are a giant question mark and arguably the largest expense on the budget. Who knows how much they'll rise in the future?! I also think that the US (and perhaps the world) has been facing a housing crisis for awhile, but we aren't really creating policies to help relieve the pressure. If we do end up magically getting those policies in place in the next few years, we won't see the effects of this until at least 5-10 years later, so I want to get in sooner, rather than later. Basically, I don't see housing getting any cheaper in the near-ish future.

\- I am starting to feel the itch to settle down, or at least start to build equity in something that is \*mine\*. I don't feel necessarily tied down by a house purchase; I know I could rent it out to someone in the future if I do change my mind, or sell and leverage to buy somewhere else. I do know I want to live abroad for at least 2 years in my future, so I think I'd rent it out at that point.

\- Remote work has made it possible for me to move. I'd love to buy in my VHCOL, but I can't afford it. I have an amazing network after working at a FAANG-level company for 5 years and I'm not too worried about career implications.

\- My partner owns his own place in another VHCOL and we are talking about me moving in with him in the next 12-18 months. We don't plan to get married. He's very open to me \*not\* paying him rent and instead using that money towards a mortgage instead, and splitting time between the two cities. The city I'm considering buying in isn't the perfect one for me \*right now\*, but when I lived there previously, I really enjoyed it and could see myself retiring there or spending part of the year there.

So yeah, I'm starting to put out some feelers and thinking about what to do. I've already started to chat with some realtors and plan on visiting in the summer to look at houses and get a feel for the market. I'm struggling a bit with how to save for this; I max out 401k and rIRA every year and my 2022 goal is to put $1500/month into a taxable brokerage. Do I just start putting that money into my HYSA instead? It feels weird to put money into a place where it'll be actively losing value due to inflation, but I also understand that it needs to be in a super stable place.

Anyways, TLDR: I am contemplating buying a house. Don't know where to start in terms of building out a down payment or starting to think about saving. Please share your experiences and thought process! Thanks :)",FIREyFemmes
1,humanbeing1979,/r/FIREyFemmes/comments/sz3gz0/question_for_the_credit_card_churners/,"Hi all. 

I started mildly churning credit cards for a few years now. Not nearly to the extent that the award travel sub does, and I def wasn't researching and utilizing my points in the most efficient way when I started (or now even), but it's been fun! I treated my mom and myself to a first class flight to NM free. My family of 3 has done a bunch of hotel/airbnb stays for free. We flew to NY for free. And we'll be going to Disneyland, flight, hotel, and tix all free. 

Now that we seem to be out of the pandemic (are we, I can't tell anymore) I thought I'd take it up a notch and quickly got 2 new cards and started doing a bit more research about a month ago. But holy moly, getting serious is extreme and the award travel sub really knows there stuff and that really intimidates me. Once I start reading wikis and specific threads and blogs, I'm instantly like WHAT NOW?! And even using tools like Award Hacker just has me doing somersaults, looking up flights that don't seem to match what Award Hacker presumes. I'm trying to understand things, but the more I read and follow instructions the less optimistic I am that I'll get things right. It seems to me that doing this award travel stuff will ultimately take so many hours of time (time = money) that it might not be worth it for this FT working mama... but that biz class to Japan is so dang tempting. 

So what is a lady to do? Go back to my old ways of utilizing points incorrectly and just go with the ignorance is bliss route? That means I'd have to let go of some dream vacations like that biz class to Japan, or Portugal, or  Iceland/London. Is this you? Are you fine with letting go of missing out on those sweet spots, but still churn for the quick/easy way to travel?

Or is there someone out there who could walk me through a flight or two? (&lt;&lt; I rather not pay the experts as it's at least $150 per person per trip and right now I'm focusing on mid 2023 which isn't even an option for flights right now) I'm so much better at learning when I can follow along, talk it out, and repeat what I've learned. I'm just not sure anyone out there would ever want to help in that way.",FIREyFemmes

I moved to a new city about a year ago and pay $1200 for a nice apartment about 20 min away from my work/downtown area. My renewal is coming up and I’m expecting rent to go up. Management told me it would likely be no more than a 10% increase, but that that could change any time. 

I toured a few other apartments for the main reason being that I’m not totally in love with the area of my current apartment. It’s close to Walmart, but to get to any local restaurants or things happening I have to drive a good 20 minutes. 

Anyway, I found an apartment that is 5 min from work/downtown area. this is ideally the location I want to be in. I can walk to restaurants, coffee , even work if i really wanted to, and more without a 20 min drive. The trade off is price. This place is understandably going to range from $1400-$1500 depending on if i get a studio or 1BR. 

I think I can afford the place, but the extra $$ I could potentially be saving vs spending makes me nervous. Do you think it would be worth it? Is a $200 difference really something to be losing sleep over (I can’t sleep because i can’t stop thinking about this ha)?",FIREyFemmes

0,meaningfulsnotname,/r/FIREyFemmes/comments/t41b7j/should_i_keep_the_house_my_sister_and_i_inherited/,"TL;DR: I need help deciding on keeping an inherited house for potential rental income or just sell. 

  
I need some objective feedback about keeping a paid off house my sister and I inherited. It's in my hometown where I grew up and visit several times a year, but  I live in another state. My sister doesn't think it's worth keeping as a rental and neither does my spouse. I think it might be though; it's just hard for me to wrap my head around the numbers because different ROI/cashflow calculators give me different numbers. I think it might be a good way for me to diversify aside from my job and index funds and get my foot into the real estate game. 

  
The 4 closest houses with similar bed/bath/sqft are listed between 55k and 85k (I can't find info for recently sold houses).

I’ve been looking for a job for about a month and randomly applied to a bank near me who was looking for a teller. It certainly wasn’t my first choice, I used to work in film and am not going back into it as of now, so am trying to figure out my next steps. I interviewed and they liked me a lot. We were in there for an hour talking and I just got formally hired today. It’s $18/hr plus a sign on bonus of $1k. 

I wish I was happier about this, but I’m kind of at a point where I’m desperate for money so I’m taking it. I’ve also become extremely passionate about finance over the past few years—in the midst of my chronic illness and losing everything—so I figure this will also be a good way to learn even more about finance. I don’t plan on staying in this position, but I just need to be an adult and get an income. I just turned 33.

I have about $4k in savings and my credit score between the three bureaus is 688 at the lowest and 714 at the highest. Experian is the highest.

So, in my quest to be financially savvy and FIREy—hopefully someday, dear God—I’ve been trying to get as much car advice as I possibly can. 

I’ve asked in here. In the Personal Finance sub—where I’m pretty much told I’m screwed 24/7, literally no room for dialogue other than me being screwed—and I’ve been told to buy a clunker for a few grand. Some people have said to lease. I’ve come to the conclusion that there are no clunkers near me for $3k that I can get in a few weeks. The least expensive used car I found on Autotrader was $10k with 157k miles on it. The market is nuts. Worst time to buy. I know. Maybe I really am screwed, but I’ve chosen to either lease or buy new. It seems like the only sound financial choice at this time. 

I have $4k in my savings. $6k in investments. My credit score is 688 on the low and 714 on the high end. I’m about to be making $18/hr for 35 to 40 hours a week. I haven’t worked in a few years so don’t have pay stubs yet, but my credit history should be very good in terms of debt repayment and I have an offer letter. 

How can I go about doing this without getting screwed in this market? Any ideas of which cars to look into for the lowest monthly prices of a lease? And any red flags while buying that I could be given tips on would be super appreciated. 

I’m not an easy sell, but I also feel like I don’t know what I’m doing and don’t have the upper hand right now. I’d love to bluff that if possible. The last time I purchased a car I was hyper privileged, left an inheritance, and foolishly (because I was unmanaged and not financially literate at all) purchased a car upfront in cash that a family member negotiated down for me.

My current setup is that I am a **W2** tech contractor through an IT talent company. I have health insurance, an HSA, have 5 days of PTO (lol) and after a year could start investing in a 401k **as a contractor** at Company A. I make $80/hr. 

The company that I am a contractor for (the client, Company B) wants to hire me in June. I'm meeting with Company A tomorrow to talk about the process. I think because I haven't been there for a year, Company B has to ""buy me out"" from Company A. 

&amp;#x200B;

But- I'm also curious about what I should expect with this process. Because I am a W2 contractor I feel like my pay wasn't inflated for me to pay quarterly taxes. I also get health insurance. The PTO situation sucks, but I can basically take as much time off and either make it up or not get paid - both of which I've used. 

&amp;#x200B;

Will I have room to negotiate a higher rate at Company B? They're most likely paying $120+/hr for me, right?  Plus, my pay hasn't changed since last July, so with all the inflation I really would like an increase.  I'd also like to negotiate a starting bonus with Company B.

0,EBeewtf,/r/FIREyFemmes/comments/t9wz5k/where_do_i_go_from_here/,"I’m 33, single, living with mom. To preface. 

I hope this isn’t going to be overwhelming, but I’m just going to dig in. Quickly, I haven’t worked for about seven years. Five from undiagnosed autoimmune disease that made me extremely chronically ill. Then two from the pandemic. I almost died from covid so we’ve had me at this sort of Watch And Wait stance to see how dangerous it would be for me to go out into the public. I’m fully vaxed. And, not sure I’m totally safe from getting it so severely ever again, but am at the point where there’s no choice and I need to make money. 

With regard to that, I got a job. Woo hoo! I’m not thrilled about what it is but I am excited to start making money and maybe even excited to learn more about finances and money. I’m going to be a teller at a bank making 18/hr with a sign on bonus. I don’t want to get stuck here. I have a bachelors degree in literature and used to work in film. Doesn’t feel like an option for me anymore. 

I want to try and get somewhere in the realm of FIRE, even if I don’t do the RE part as early as I’d like to. How do I do this now?

Here are my numbers:

Around $6k (and going down with the market) in investments. 

$4k in savings that I may lose soon because I need a car. 

$18/hr for the foreseeable future, but likely not longer than a year. I’m planning on figuring out what to do in that time. Most likely will go back to school for my masters. 

This is an issue I have. Aside from pretty much being broke and having to help support my mother. I used to be extremely privileged, but it was fake privilege. A smoke screen of a stable life that actually wasn’t stable at all. I grew up in my grandparent’s home in a nice suburb. I was left a fairly hefty (about $100k) inheritance by my father’s parents because my father was completely absent from my life. My mother didn’t receive child support. Nothing. I really didn’t understand money or it’s importance. My mother never took money seriously and she is in a HORRIBLE financial position because of it at almost 65. Bad credit. No net worth. No retirement. She literally does not have teeth in her mouth right now because she can’t afford implants and is having problems with regular dentures. While I was sick we pretty much became homeless because my grandparents decided then of all times to sell their house. 

It’s the reason I have become even as financially savvy as I am now. And I could be a LOAD better. But I was able to help us survive through the pandemic by budgeting and hoarding whatever money was coming in. I got my credit score up to 714 (lowest is 688 with Transunion, I think). I am the one who is most financially stable, though she will be bringing in the majority of the money. I manage it. 

I am used to paying in cash for everything from that inheritance. I was not managed. No one in my family or the lawyer it was left with ever sat me down and explained that money to me, what could be done with it, or how to use it properly. It’s pretty much gone. It’s the $6k (and going down) in investments that I have leftover. And the $4k in savings that is about to go towards a car, though I’m trying not to lose it to a car. The market is so horrible right now. My inheritance was spent on utter bullshit and paying for my first car—brand new, in cash for about $20k—and college tuition in cash. Biggest, largest, hugest, deepest regrets on earth. Aside from whatever dimension I walked into that put me in a world of being poor and ill, THAT is my deepest regret in life. But it was given to me young and I was ignorant. I did not have the tools or knowledge I have now. 

I just want to be comfortable and have a safe financial life. I don’t want to get stuck being a teller. Or stuck in low paying jobs. It is my goal to be making six figures by the time I’m 40. Even if that means going back to school and furthering my education in something that will pay that much. 

How do I be smart from here? I’m going to, on the low end, be bringing home about $850 every two weeks if I work only 30/hrs a week. I’m full time, which I thought meant 40/hrs a week, but they did ask me if I’d do 30 in the interview.

Im trying to find the silver lining in the situation. I’ve become very passionate about money and finances and financial education in the past few years from everything and being sick. Maybe this will lead somewhere great for me. I don’t know. Im actually really bad with any math other than basic, so who knows. 

I know this is a lot. But, I’m just trying to make good decisions and don’t have anyone in my support network to turn to. I feel like I’ve been around people who have been more than happy to watch me fail. Im distanced from most of them so, it’s just me and my mom right now. Im trying to be smart for the both of us. 

Some more numbers:

I have about a $20k credit limit. 

My rent is higher in the summer so I’ll have to put away $1k a month just for that for the next few months. But then I’ve worked things out to something like:

Rent: $675
Utilities: $200
Savings: $350 to $500 (goal)
Car payment and insur: $400 ish

This leaves me with about $80 of play money per month which is nothing. I’ll probably put it towards gas. And I’ll to get things lower.

Since my i was in my teens I’ve been a hardcore saver and budgeter. I bought my apartment at 22 and spent a few years renovating it. My mortgage is fairly cheap and although I did borrow some money to do the renovations, my overall debt is still pretty low for someone my age (28). 

Lately I’ve realised that I’ve been being too strict. I’m comfortable now and there’s no reason to deprive myself. I’ve spend a long time denying myself the nicer things in life and I’m just over it. 

I decided to take a few weeks off putting money into savings and I’ve been giving myself complete freedom and just ordering all the stuff that I need that I always put off because it’s “not in the budget” and damn it feels good. I did a big grocery order, cat food and litter, clothes, and I even ordered a meal kit delivery service to start in a few weeks time. I booked myself a massage for the weekend! 

I grew up what I like to call “farm poor”. We always had plenty to eat but there was never much extra money for other things and my parents really have an attitude about “wasting money” on “unnecessary things” and it really rubbed off on me. It feels good to let go of it a little bit. I felt poor even though I’m financially ok and there was no reason for it. 

I’ll probably get back on track with savings in a couple of months after I buy all the stuff that I’ve put off for so long, but I won’t be as strict as before. I’ll give myself much more buffer in future.

I'm in a relatively safe area of the company. My whole line of management is gone and I've been reorganized into a new team. I used to manage a team of 7 people before but everyone left so I'm left with 1. My new chain of management has a lot of new people and they are also trying to figure out what to do, so I'm kind of left on my own as me and my direct report are fairly unproblematic and have some critical routine work to stay occupied. There is no pressure, no stress but also no intellectual challenge or morale or motivation. Some days I feel my brain cells are dying. 

On the plus side, I have a lot of free time and I'm trying to use it on my resume and trainings. I'm starting to reach out to people in other companies.

0,heyeurydice,/r/FIREyFemmes/comments/tbb7sg/future_inlaws_offered_to_pay_my_student_loans_off/,"Hi folks and femmes! There was recently a thread about this from the lender's side, but I had some borrower’s-side questions.

My fiancée and I are getting married this fall. Our finances are already semi-combined: we live together, share household bills and insurance, have a joint savings account and joint credit card, and talk about retirement and savings goals as a household, but maintain separate checking accounts. Both of our parents paid for undergrad education, then we were responsible for grad school. My fiancée initially had federal loans for grad school, but her parents offered to pay off the fed loan and switch to a zero-interest loan from them. She owes her parents $X. I graduated recently and have made progress on my loans, which are around $1.5 X (at around 6.5% interest in total).They are currently in COVID forbearance so they aren’t accruing interest. 

COVID forbearance ends in May. In anticipation of this, my fiancée asked her parents whether she could “refinance” her loans so that we could throw a greater portion of our student loan repayment budget at my loans to cut down on the total interest we’d pay. We were imagining something like reducing her payment to them for a bit, having her pay the saved amount onto my loans, then making it up with her parents later. I was totally shocked when they offered to just pay mine off and switch to a zero-interest loan with them. It’s such a generous offer, and I think financially it makes a lot of sense to do it. But I'm nervous about what to do to make sure everyone is protected.

What I know:

- We won't do this deal before we get married.
- I want to have a written agreement with an amount owed, repayment schedule, and what percentage of our monthly payment goes towards my balance with them vs. her balance with them. (When they did her loans, they did not have a written agreement and she keeps her records of what she has paid and still owes in an iPhone note, yikes).
- They don’t need this amount of money any time soon, and have had a “we’ll call this a loan, but if it was a gift, that’d be okay” mindset when dealing with money and family.
- I know PF reddit would jump down my throat for this, but based on how well my fiancée and her parents have handled loans and boundaries so far, I’m not worried that this would have a negative impact on our relationship.

My questions:

- Is this something we need a lawyer for? Or are there good templates out there?
- What else should be in the agreement beyond the amount owed and payment schedule?
- If I were to die today, my federal loans would die with me, whereas theoretically this loan would go to my estate. I’m nervous about what would happen if I give up that protection. Is there a standard for what to do with personal loans if someone dies?

I've been struggling recently with feeling like I'm not earning to the full potential mostly based on being in a lower paying geographical location.  

A lot of people/young people in my country leave here because our neighbor pays about 30-50% or more in salary for the same role. This phenomenon is called the ""Brain Drain"". 

COL is pretty much the same for both locations, both are HCOL/VHOL. Maybe you'll know which countries I am talking about. 

My partner is in mid-high level Software and I can't help but think that he could earn about $40k-$60k more in the other country. So we are missing out on a lot of money each year. 

For me, I have changed industries a lot of time in my early 20s, and have finally settled in a decent paying role, albeit entry-level in my current country. However, I can't help but think that I will also be able to earn more in the other country. 

I will likely need to stay in my current role for a year or so before being able to move on/move countries. I just can't help but think about how much more salary we could earn (more-so my partner being able to earn more) overseas right now. 

Has anyone come across this type of dilemma? Wanting to move for better pay but couldn't for a certain time-frame?",FIREyFemmes

0,Sipazianna,/r/FIREyFemmes/comments/tgeo5s/help_me_take_a_great_job_offer_to_my_current_boss/,"Just had a great interview for a $95k job and I have a written offer coming in for it shortly. Currently in a $73k job that I'd prefer to stay in because it's more interesting and is full-time WFH. $95k job would be boring full-time office with no WFH option ever for security reasons. I love WFH, but wow, that $22k bump!! 

For reference, I'm 28 and about to get married, LCOL area, $16k in 11.5% interest credit card debt, $14k in 3.5-5.5% interest student loans. My future spouse can't work because he's on a fiancé visa and needs to wait 8-12 months for his work permit. I can put $2k/month towards my debt at my current position and would be able to put $4k/month towards my debt at the $95k position if my math is right.

I've tried to negotiate higher pay in my current position with repeated flat denials. My boss says she wants to promote me this June, but I've seen multiple people promoted since I started with this company who did NOT receive any kind of raise with their promotion (including my boss). Current company says that both mid-year and end-of-year raises are firmly capped at 5%. 

My boss and our project lead keep telling me I'm vital to our success with our client and that my contributions have helped them vastly expand the contract, that the team would fall apart if I were hit by a bus, etc. and our project lead bragged yesterday about how much money he has to hire new staff with, so I feel like I have a good shot at negotiating a raise using this offer as leverage. But I've never done something like this before. Can the femmes provide any advice? Phrases to avoid? Phrases to use?

Right now I'm thinking of something like ""I received a call from a recruiter yesterday about a similar position with a $95,000 salary and comparable benefits package. My interview went very well and I have an offer letter in hand. I'd like to stay with this team, but this is a very difficult offer to turn down and it's really making me think about the current job market and the expected compensation for someone with my experience and skills in this kind of role. What can \[current company\] offer me in this situation?""

If current company refuses, I'm fine with taking the $95k job. It's just not my preferred role because I love WFH. So if this all goes wrong and I have to take the $95k job, I'll survive. 

Any help with wording, approach, etc. y'all can provide is greatly appreciated!! &lt;3",FIREyFemmes
0,FunQuestion,/r/FIREyFemmes/comments/tglob0/have_you_ever_used_a_career_coach_what_was_your/,"Hi all! I posted this on r/AskWomenOver30 and it was recommended I post here.

I currently earn $80k after stepping down from another, much higher paying  position (management) at another company earning $98k. I had to step down due to the workload and inflexibility of meetings during the pandemic and felt like an individual contributor role would be more manageable until school/daycare closures were no longer a thing.

Now I want to get back on track to where I was pre-pandemic - especially since this current role is at a very disorganized company with a lot of ambiguity working for some very defensive people, so the stress levels of the individual contributor role are almost as high as they were as a manager and the pay absolutely does not match the level of stress or amount of work required.

I’ve had some struggles in my career and a lot of job hopping - some of it due to poor treatment at work (apparently I’m high maintenance for expecting to not be sexually harassed…), some of it due to circumstances - bought a house on the complete opposite side of the city from my job and the commute was terrible, etc.

I’m currently considering working with a coach who is 1) a part time coach while working full-time in my field which seems very valuable and 2) is a former therapist which seems like an amazing combo. I’ve also seen multiple recommendations for her from people in my field. I’m worried though because she needs a 12 session commitment which will ultimately cost $2500 - when you’re earning $80k in a high COL area, that’s a lot of money. But if it helps me earn $100k-$135k (I’m qualified for many jobs at that level) it’s a worthwhile investment. I just think I need some 1:1 help.

I would love some tips on how to be a better communicator. I know my stuff, theoretically, but I am absolutely terrible at getting my point across in meetings. I panic a little and jumble up my words. Also doesn’t help that I’ve had brain fog since my daughter was born.

0,melodiousrabbit,/r/FIREyFemmes/comments/thvqdn/books_foron_very_high_income_woman/,"I grew up thinking I’d do a passion job that doesn’t pay much, maybe 40-50k. I was great about finances at that level. I ended up starting a business and after a couple years grind I now make over 100k. 

I had imposter syndrome and I had to read a lot of books just to get used to seeing myself as someone who makes that much, earned that much and can do cool things with money beyond just surviving. I found a lot of helpful books for that.

Now I’m ready for the next level. I want to be a woman who earns mid 6 figures and I know my little business can get me there but I want to read more books about or for women who are already there. I feel like most financial books are targeting the 100k range and under. 

Any suggestions? I read all sorts of finance books but a book with a feminine slant is preferred

 Btw, if you’ve had a similar question books I’ve read so far that I felt went were after the higher income woman include:
